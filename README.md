# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points.
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Assign the values for x and y 
### Step 2: 
To find the distance between two points.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the value.
### Step 5:
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math
x=[10,4]
y=[6,2]
value=math.sqrt(((x[0]-x[1])**2)+((y[0]-y[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(value))
```
### OUTPUT:
